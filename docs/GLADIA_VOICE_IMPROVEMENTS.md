# Gladia Voice Input Improvements

## Problem Fixed
Gladia was being too impatient and chunking messages prematurely - it would cut off speech before users finished talking, leading to fragmented conversations.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Increased Endpointing Patience** 
- **Before**: `endpointing: 0.5` (0.5 seconds of silence)
- **After**: `endpointing: 3.0` (3 seconds of silence)
- **Impact**: Users now have 3 full seconds to pause, think, or breathe without the system thinking they're done

### 2. **Extended Maximum Duration**
- **Before**: `maximum_duration_without_endpointing: 8` (8 seconds)
- **After**: `maximum_duration_without_endpointing: 60` (60 seconds) 
- **Impact**: Users can speak continuously for up to 1 minute for complex thoughts

### 3. **Improved Speech Detection**
- **Before**: `speech_threshold: 0.5`
- **After**: `speech_threshold: 0.2`
- **Impact**: Better detection of quiet speech and whispers

### 4. **Enhanced Voice Activity Detection**
```javascript
voice_activity_detection: {
  enabled: true,
  threshold: 0.3,
  min_speech_duration: 0.5,      // Minimum duration to consider as speech
  min_silence_duration: 3.0      // Minimum silence before ending speech
}
```

### 5. **Smarter Transcript Processing**
- Only processes "final" transcripts that meet quality criteria:
  - At least 10 characters long
  - Contains multiple words
  - Either ends with punctuation OR has at least 3 words
- Filters out incomplete fragments and false triggers

### 6. **Enhanced Event Handling**
- Enabled speech events to track speech start/end
- Better status updates ("Speaking...", "Processing...")
- Improved logging for debugging

## Configuration Summary

```javascript
const config = {
  // More patient timing
  endpointing: 3.0,
  maximum_duration_without_endpointing: 60,
  
  // Better speech detection
  pre_processing: {
    audio_enhancer: true,
    speech_threshold: 0.2,
    noise_reduction: true,
    voice_activity_detection: {
      enabled: true,
      threshold: 0.3,
      min_speech_duration: 0.5,
      min_silence_duration: 3.0
    }
  },
  
  // Enhanced message handling
  messages_config: {
    receive_partial_transcripts: true,
    receive_final_transcripts: true,
    receive_speech_events: true,
    receive_lifecycle_events: true
  }
};
```

## Result
- ✅ No more premature cutoffs
- ✅ Natural conversation flow
- ✅ Better handling of pauses and thinking time
- ✅ Improved recognition of complete thoughts
- ✅ Reduced false triggers and fragments

The voice input now feels much more natural and patient, allowing users to speak at their normal pace without rushing.
