# ðŸŽ¯ UI Cleanup & Sensitivity Balance

## Changes Made

### 1. **Hidden Debug Elements**
- **Status Indicator** (top area): Now commented out with "DEBUG ONLY" label
- **Avatar Info** (bottom area): Now commented out with "DEBUG ONLY" label
- Both can be easily re-enabled by uncommenting when debugging is needed

### 2. **Balanced Microphone Sensitivity**
The microphone was made less sensitive but now needs to hear you properly:

**Adjusted Settings:**
- **Speech Threshold**: 0.7 â†’ 0.6 (more responsive)
- **Confidence Filter**: 0.65 â†’ 0.6 (accepts more speech)
- **Endpointing**: 0.8s â†’ 0.6s (faster response)
- **Noise Gate**: 0.02 â†’ 0.015 (slightly more sensitive)

**Status Messages:**
- "Listening (balanced)..." when active
- "Ready (balanced filtering)" when standby

### 3. **Clean UI Experience**
- No more distracting debug info on screen
- Only essential elements visible:
  - Avatar
  - Voice transcript (when speaking)
  - Chat input
  - Voice status indicator (bottom left)
- Debug elements easily re-enabled for troubleshooting

## How to Re-enable Debug Elements

In `pages/index.tsx`, uncomment these sections:

```typescript
// Uncomment for debugging:
/* <div className={`status-indicator ...`}>
  ...
</div> */

// Uncomment for debugging:
/* <div className="avatar-info">
  ...
</div> */
```

## Expected Results

âœ… **Cleaner UI**: No distracting debug elements  
âœ… **Better Mic Sensitivity**: Can hear you but filters background  
âœ… **Maintained Accuracy**: All speech recognition improvements preserved  
âœ… **Easy Debugging**: Quick uncomment to re-enable debug info when needed
